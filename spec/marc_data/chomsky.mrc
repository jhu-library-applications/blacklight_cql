In their first book together, Chomsky and Achcar bring a keen understanding of the internal dynamics of the Middle East and of the role of the United States. They take up all the key questions of interest to concerned citizens, including such topics as terrorism, fundamentalism, conspiracies, oil, democracy, self-determination, anti-Semitism, and anti-Arab racism, as well as the war in Afghanistan, the invasion and occupation of Iraq, the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the 2006 Israel-Hamas-Hezbollah armed conflict, and the sources of U.S. foreign policy."--BOOK JACKET. 0aMiddle EastxForeign relationszUnited States. 0aUnited StatesxForeign relationszMiddle East. 0aTerrorismxGovernment policyzUnited States. 0aIraq War, 2003-xProtest movementszUnited States. 0aInsurgencyzIraq. 0aDemocracyzMiddle East.1 aAchcar, Gilbert.1 aShalom, Stephen Rosskamm,d1948-413Table of contents onlyuhttp://www.loc.gov/catdir/toc/ecip0617/2006021980.html23a.05fepoli1b.2007  aBaker & TaylorbBKTYc22.95d17.21i1594513120n0006776861sactive  aYBP Library ServicesbYANKn2418933  aC0bJHE  a2630804bHorizon bib#  aDS63.2.U5 C445 2007cc. 1i4412645lemainmemselsotenorm
